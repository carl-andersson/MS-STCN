# MS-STCN

This gitub contains the code used for [Paper_link]. 

The code is run by using `python run.py` and can be run interactively (for evaluation) or in training mode.

Options for the model can be sent in as a json encoded dictionary `python run.py --options options.txt` or by modifying the `default_options.py` (Explicit options will override default options)
